# Desire Stuff Tab
The Desired Stuff Tab creates a location for users to store parameters for easy
access later on without having to find the node in the Nodegraph.

Parameters and nodes can be dragged/dropped into the left side to make them
accessible later.  If a node is dropped, then all of the parameters on that
node will be visible.

# How to use
1. **Add parameters** <br />
        Parameters can be added by drag/dropping parameters or nodes into the
        left side of the display.
2. **Create new group** <br />
        Type a new name into the `Create New Group` area
3. **View parameters** <br />
        Parameters can be viewed/unviewed by clicking on the item.
