# Variable Manager
The Variable Manager is an all in one place for a user to manage a GSV switch.
Rather than having to setup `Variable Switches` and `VariableEnabledGroups`.  The
Variable Manager will control the GSV flow for an entire section of the Nodegraph
for a specific GSV. It will do this by allowing users to create new GSV branches,
and containers for those branches to easily manage the inheritance between them.

There is also a separate local publishing system that can be used.  This was probably
a rather ambitious project, and the results of the local publishing system may still be buggy.

# Parameters
GSV
Node Type

Display Tree
Pattern/Block Creator

Parameter Display Area

# Note
This is very  old crappy code.  It's some of the first I've ever written, however the benefits of
the tool are still valid.  This tool really needs a complete overhaul, as I really have no idea
how it works anymore, except for that most of the bugs have been worked out.

Most likely you will find bugs in the publishing system.  That entire thing is a nightmare, and was
a horrible idea.
